# Overview

At here, I’ll cover how to fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-4-o model using OpenAI’s tools. We'll move through the end-to-end pipeline, from data preparation to monitoring the deployed model.  
&nbsp;
Fine-tuning is the process of training a pre-trained model using custom data for a specific task. For example, if we want to develop a chatbot for customer service or deploy an HR AI agent to automate tasks, we can fine-tune a pre-trained model to meet these needs.  
&nbsp;
Why fine-tuning? Here are the 3 main reasons:  
    - Task-Specific Accuracy: To adapt the model for a specific use case.  
    - Cost-Effective: Reduces the need for training a model from scratch.  
    - Improved Performance: Enhances results using domain-specific data.  

## Data Preparation

Here we go, a demo use case of fine-tuning a customer service model.  
I will use a customer service center dataset to fine-tune the model, focusing on a specific task and improving performance with domain-specific data.

## Model Selection

Model = gpt-4o

## Training Setup

In first round, i am sing auto-configuration to get a baseline result without manually tuning the hyperparameters. Second round, i analyze the results and manually adjust the hyperparameters.  
&nbsp;
E.g.  
Number of epochs=3  
Start with a small value (e.g., 3-5) to prevent overfitting. Increase only if the model shows improvement on the validation set.
&nbsp;
Batch size= 1  
We start from 1 here. Smaller sizes (e.g., 1 or 16) work well for limited memory.  
&nbsp;
Learning rate multiplier=1
